 # gitwhipper

gitwhipper is a Git workflow assistant that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the development process. It aids developers by providing automated documentation generation and intelligent recommendations to improve Git workflows.

## Introduction

gitwhipper streamlines Git workflows by leveraging LLMs to provide commit message suggestions, automated changelog generation, and other productivity-enhancing features. By integrating these AI models directly into the Git client, gitwhipper aims to make software development more efficient and less tedious.

Key capabilities include intelligent commit message generation, automated code review assistance, and project documentation creation. Rather than replacing the developer, gitwhipper augments human creativity and judgment - the developer remains firmly in control.

## Key Features

- **Commit message generation** - LLMs suggest succinct, informative commit messages based on file changes. This speeds up the commit process and leads to improved project history.

- **Code review assistance** - LLMs analyze proposed code changes and offer insights to enhance code quality and spot potential issues. This allows faster, higher-quality reviews.  

- **Automated changelog creation** - Commit messages and PR titles are automatically compiled into a change log reflecting project improvements over time.

- **Enhanced CLI** - Traditional Git CLI augmented with LLM-generated insights for commits, diffs, reverts and more.
